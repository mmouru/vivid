vivid. was designed by me and two other students from Oulu CSE as mobile application part of "Human Computer Interaction" course. 
The idea was to make a application where users could post pictures of interior designs and search inspiration from other users.
We ended up achieving the highest grade from the class and that inspired me to continue the development.
Ive been developing this web app on my freetime for awhile now and decided to push it to internet.
